# BubGAN
Bubble Generative Adversarial Networks (BubGAN) for Bubbly Flow Synthesis. This tool can be used for synthetic bubbly flow generation with your own customized bubbly flow boundary conditions. The single sythetic bubbles ara already pre-generated from the BubGAN algorithm.  A total of one million synthetic bubbles are stored in the MillionBubble Data Base with known bubble properties. 

The main script is Main_ImageGeneration.m  

You need to downlaod the MillionBubbleDataBase at:  http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/mxnzxzc6v7.1
